# TODO:
# - Create README elaborating how to run this with documentation of required
# changes in SCALE-MAMBA source code (eg. IO.h, Player.cpp and
# new Input_Output_<user_defined>.cpp files)
# - Implement possibility for external input of sfloats. Changes in library
# might be required.
# - Implement multidimenitonal CustVector (to have x and y values in one vector)
